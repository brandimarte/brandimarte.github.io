##### Abstract

A nanographene formed by the fusion of 22 benzene rings has been prepared by combining an in-solution Pd-catalyzed cycloaddition reaction and on-surface Au-promoted cyclodehydrogenation.
The structure and electronic properties of the resulting three-fold symmetric C<sub>66</sub>H<sub>24</sub> molecule have been characterized by scanning probe microscopy with atomic resolution and corroborated by theoretical modelling.
