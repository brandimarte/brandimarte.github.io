##### Abstract

The electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) can be precisely tuned by chemical doping.
Here we demonstrate that amino (NH<sub>2</sub>) functional groups attached at the edges of chiral GNRs (chGNRs) can efficiently gate the chGNRs and lead to the valence band (VB) depopulation on a metallic surface.
The NH<sub>2</sub>-doped chGNRs are grown by on-surface synthesis on Au(111) using functionalized bianthracene precursors.
Scanning tunneling spectroscopy resolves that the NH<sub>2</sub> groups significantly upshift the bands of chGNRs, causing the Fermi level crossing of the VB onset of chGNRs.
Through density functional theory simulations we confirm that the hole-doping behavior is due to an upward shift of the bands induced by the edge NH<sub>2</sub> groups.
