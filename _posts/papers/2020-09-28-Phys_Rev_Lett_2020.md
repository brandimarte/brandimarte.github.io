##### Abstract

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), low-dimensional platforms for carbon-based electronics, show the promising perspective to also incorporate spin polarization in their conjugated electron system.
However, magnetism in GNRs is generally associated with localized states around zigzag edges, difficult to fabricate and with high reactivity.
Here we demonstrate that magnetism can also be induced away from physical GNR zigzag edges through atomically precise engineering topological defects in its interior.
A pair of substitutional boron atoms inserted in the carbon backbone breaks the conjugation of their topological bands and builds two spin-polarized boundary states around them.
The spin state was detected in electrical transport measurements through boron-substituted GNRs suspended between the tip and the sample of a scanning tunneling microscope.
First-principle simulations find that boron pairs induce a spin 1, which is modified by tuning the spacing between pairs.
Our results demonstrate a route to embed spin chains in GNRs, turning them into basic elements of spintronic devices.
