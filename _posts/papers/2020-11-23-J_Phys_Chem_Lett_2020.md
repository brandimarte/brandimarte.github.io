##### Abstract

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and their derivatives attract growing attention due to their excellent electronic and magnetic properties as well as the fine-tuning of such properties that can be obtained by heteroatom substitution and/or edge morphology modification.
Here, we introduce graphene nanoribbon derivatives -- organometallic hybrids with gold atoms incorporated between the carbon skeleton and side Cl atoms.
We show that narrow chlorinated 5-AGNROHs (armchair graphene nanoribbon organometallic hybrids) can be fabricated by on-surface polymerization with omission of the cyclodehydrogenation reaction by a proper choice of tailored molecular precursors.
Finally, we describe a route to exchange chlorine atoms connected through gold atoms to the carbon skeleton by hydrogen atom treatment.
This is achieved directly on the surface, resulting in perfect unsubstituted hydrogen-terminated GNRs.
This will be beneficial in the molecule on-surface processing when the preparation of final unsubstituted hydrocarbon structure is desired.
