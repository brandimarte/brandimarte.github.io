It's not easy to break into a new field of knowledge, specially one that is rapidly evolving.
To get to know the state-of-the-art on the field of deep learning and to be able to follow the recent research papers, it's important to get familiar with its earlier advances.
In this topic I'll trace a road map for reading the most relevant research articles.
Besides going through reviews, I'll try to follow a chronological order.
For each article, I'll to include here some notes, which are intended to help me refresh my memory when necessary.
